# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression-Model
---Project Overview---
This project involves predicting house prices based on various features using a Linear Regression model.
The dataset includes factors such as square footage, number of rooms, and location, which are used to predict the house price.
The project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems like predicting property values.
---Technologies Used---
Python: Programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical calculations.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the linear regression model.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizations and data exploration.
---Results---
The model performs well with an RÂ² score of 88.39%, indicating that 88.39% of the variance in house prices is explained by the model.
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 1.95 billion, which is considered acceptable given the scale of house prices.
